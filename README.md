# Logic-Analyser
A dinky little device that allows you to "see" I2C, SPI and many more signals

# See video #99 Logic Analyser for I2C, SPI and more at https://www.youtube.com/RalphBacon

So we Arduinites use I2C and SPI (and maybe a couple of other protocols) without really giving too much thought to what is happening to the signals going down the wires - until it goes wrong, that is!

This cheeky little module lets us visualise exactly what is going on, using your PC as the screen and the USB cable as the means to transmit the signals back to the PC. The software is easy enough to install if a little time consuming(follow the instructions EXACTLY) and watch the demo to see how to use the Sigrok Pulseview utility with an Arduino. It is really brings the whole I2C bus (and others) to life.

Amazon UK site of the actual product but widely available

In the US, go to Amazon.com and search for "usb 8ch 24mhz 8 channel logic analyzer" and 
you will get (seemingly) identical products like this one:  
https://www.amazon.com/Logic-Analyzer-Device-Cable-Channel/dp/B06Y2TTFR1  
Needless to say, the USA does everything bigger so you get a choice of about 8 similar products!

I've placed the RTC (Real Time Clock) sketch from video #19 I use here (plus the I2C scanner) here in my GitHub repository, super easy to download!
